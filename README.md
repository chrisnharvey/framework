EncorePHP
=========

EncorePHP is a desktop application framework for PHP. It uses wxWidgets and wxPHP to easily create a cross-platform desktop application using PHP, but is easily extensible to use any desktop development extension.

Because EncorePHP is a PHP framework, this means that you do not have to wait for the application to compile every time you want to test a change you've made to your code. Simply run ```php bin/encore debug``` from the CLI to view your application instantly.

EncorePHP takes advantage of a lot of components from the Laravel framework, and we aim to make desktop app development as expressive as Laravel has made web app development.

EncorePHP is still under active development, so if you have any ideas, suggestions, enhancements or bug fixes then please feel free to submit an issue or pull request on the respective repository that your issue relates to.
